The Gambia’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), on the 2023 International Women’s Day, urged the government of the Gambia to empower women by curbing high costs of digital connections and digitizing ‘Osusu’, the traditional community-based savings groups to provide financing for women. The statement from the NHRC underscored the wide inequalities between men and women in areas including political participation and representation, education, economic status, and access to digital technology.","GMB"
"Zimbabwe","Zunde raMambo","The ‘Ubuntu’ philosophy is “a spirit of togetherness and fear of punishment from ancestral spirits”, which helps instil a sense of obligation among community members to provide assistance to fellow members in case of invalidity, sickness, death and old age. Ubuntu plays a crucial role in preserving traditional values and embraces qualities such as warmth, empathy, understanding, communication, interaction, participation, reciprocation, harmony, a shared worldview and cooperation.    

Zunde raMambo (Chief's Granary): One of the oldest traditional social safety nets based on the spirit of collectivism. This involved people working in a common field owned by the chief. The harvest generated would then be mobilized and kept as relief food supply in the chief’s granary to feed vulnerable groups, including the elderly, orphans, and widows, especially in times of distress such as drought or famine. All members of the community contribute grain annually to the Zunde raMambo under the chief’s supervision.","ZWE"

"Tanzania","Cooperative societies","Cooperative societies are used to meet the food security needs of the people. In the 1950s and 1960s, Tanzania had the third largest co-operative movement in the world. The cooperatives provided economic and social protection to members so that poor peasants could sell their crops even in years of bad world market prices. The services provided by cooperatives, like education and trusteeship for peasants who took out loans, collapsed when the government abolished co-operatives in 1976. They were re-introduced in 1982 but, due to their abolition, they had lost capital, personnel and members. The current co-operatives are much weaker than the pre-1976 ones and cannot provide the same kind of protection they once did. Co-operatives have still a great potential for social and economic protection but much change in the government policy on co-operatives is needed.","TZA"
"Ethiopia","Ǝddər","‘Ǝddər’ refers to associations of mutual help of indigenous origin similar to associations elsewhere in Africa. It was established originally to provide mutual aid in burial matters and other community based concerns and has evolved into a multifunctional institution of self-help and solidarity. 

Membership of an əddər can vary from 100 to more than 1,000 people. Every full member is required to pay monthly or annual dues and contributes to special calls to be made to the əddər. The əddər provides both cash and in-kind support as well as socio-psychological assistance to members facing a hardship, including death, sickness, house-fires, and accidents. Some əddərs use the accumulated money for social services such as road construction, building of new schools and clinics. In recent years, some əddərs have started to venture into business by renting its properties to non-members. As such, these əddərs are linked to the formal sector through their relationships with banks. Described by some as “informal insurance system” that functions based on risk polling and risk sharing, əddərs play an important role in bridging the gap between the banking system and the informal sector.","ETH"

"Ethiopia","Ǝqqub","Ǝqqub is a popular traditional credit association mainly in urban areas of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Over time, əqqub has evolved from a trust-based union of acquaintances into large associations that can mobilize substantial financial resources. 

Ǝqqubs usually operate on a set of well-defined rules. It is usually administered by a secretary, elected due to their integrity and ability to command respect in the community, who collects a fixed amount of payment from each participant. Ǝqqub is typically composed of 12, 26, or 52 individuals (shares). Based on the principle of ‘effective shares’, members who cannot individually afford a full share can contribute a fraction of the share, allowing people from different income classes to participate in the əqqub. The operation of the əqqub is founded on the basis of rotating access to a continually reconstituted fund, similar to ‘osusu’ in West African countries. Members make monthly payments and each month, one member receives the fund and first becomes a debtor to all members, while the person who receives it last is a creditor to the rest until they last contribution is made. A member in need may approach the group and receive the credit in a given month. Otherwise, the lot is drawn to determine the entitled person. The process continues until each member has been a winner, then a fresh cycle starts.","ETH"

In Algeria, Zakat is considered as an Islamic safety net to combat poverty and enhance social welfare. Distribution of the Zakat funds according to the Ministerial order are as follows: 50% goes to the Fuqara (the poor) and the Al-Masakin (the needy); 37.5% is directed to investments; and 12.5% is for the management of Zakat Fund expenses.

Zakar is collected from individuals in the sources such as gold, silver and other metals; agricultural outputs; animal resources; commercial profits; and gained money (from selling and using assets). Zakat policies aim to give priority to the poor, orphans, widows, the sick, the disabled, the elderly, and university students from poor households.  In addition, they support capacity development centers for women and young people. The poor are identified by the Zakat Chamber based on a poverty census conducted in 2011, which identified 2,291,789 poor households.  In 2017, 71% of the Sudanese Zakat fund was allocated to the poor and the needy.","SDN"

"Cabo Verde","Djuntamon","Djuda means “to support others in solving problem or performing an activity, without expecting anything in return”; and ""Djunta-mo/djuntamon"" refers to a kind of bartering in labor without the use of money. The ‘djuntamon’ system, which means ‘joining hands’, originated in rural Cabo Verde as a form of mutual aid among peasants. In its original form it involved the voluntary provision of labor by a collective group of neighbors for the benefit of one individual, who provides an equivalent amount of labor in return in the future. Since its original agricultural form, it has long since part of the collective strategies of the urban life in Cabo Verde. 

Women have acquired a leading role in the transfer of this practice to the urban environment, which now includes the organization and provision of work related to domestic work such as cooking or childcare. The djuntamon system is characterized by a great variability in form and function within the Cabo Verdean archipelago as residents adjust to the process of urbanization. 

In fact, the concept of djuntamon is so deeply ingrained in the country’s identity that in a 2020 special edition UN bulletin on “COVID-10 and the UN Cabo Verde Response” published in June , the UN Resident Coordinator in Cabo Verde, Ms. Ana Patrícia Graça, emphasizes the importance of togetherness in her editorial and says that “the United Nations, from the very first moment, has been alongside its partners in a DjuntaMon, which in difficult times is stronger than ever.”","CPV"
